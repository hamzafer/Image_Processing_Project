# Advanced Image Processing Techniques in MATLAB

## Project Overview
This comprehensive MATLAB project spans multiple weeks, focusing on advanced image processing techniques. From initial image capture and editing to exploring sophisticated transformations and compression methods, the project covers a broad spectrum of digital image processing tasks.

## Weekly Breakdown
- **Week 1:** Image capture and basic editing.
- **Week 2:** Custom histogram functions, segmentation, and normalization.
- **Week 3:** Histogram matching with different source images.
- **Week 4:** Local enhancement and distortion correction.
- **Week 6:** Fourier Transform analysis and image reconstruction.
- **Week 7:** Exploring DCT, Walsh, and Hadamard transforms.
- **Week 8:** Creative image resizing techniques.
- **Week 9:** JPEG compression steps and color quantization techniques.

## Technologies Used
- MATLAB
- Image Processing Toolbox

## How to Use
1. Ensure MATLAB and the Image Processing Toolbox are installed.
2. Open the scripts corresponding to each week's tasks.
3. Run the scripts in MATLAB to process the images and observe the results.
